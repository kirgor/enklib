=======
Libraries for Java, which are designed to be simple and lightweight.

Description
------------
These libraries are intended for Java EE mostly, but nothing stops you from using all of them in Java SE as well (except of **EJB** library).

*Detailed documentation in form of examples and Javadocs will be available later, sorry for lack of them right now.*

License
--------
Libraries are licensed using the MIT license, see the disclaimer in LICENSE.txt. 

Basically, you can use them for any purpose, change them, copy them, rape them, whatever. Just don't forget about the disclaimer mentioned above - it should be visible for your software users somehow.
