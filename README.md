Enklib is open source framework for Java. Its components are designed to be simple and lightweight, they allow to make less code and, in most cases, no configuration files.

Description
------------
The framework is intended for Java EE mostly, but nothing stops you from using its components in Java SE as well (except of [EJB](/kirgor/enklib/wiki/ejb) library).

Enklib's functionality is distributed among components:

1. [SQL](/kirgor/enklib/wiki/sql) - lightweight ORM, which doesn't require any configuration files.
2. [EJB](/kirgor/enklib/wiki/ejb) - library for EJB-powered services with RESTful API (via JAX-RS), password based authentication, 3. persistent sessions identified by cookies, and data access layer powered by stored procedures.
3. [Compile](/kirgor/enklib/wiki/compile) - runtime in-memory compiling of Java classes.
4. [REST](/kirgor/enklib/wiki/rest) - library for RESTful clients.
5. [Common](/kirgor/enklib/wiki/common) - other handy functions (btw, it's the core framework component)
